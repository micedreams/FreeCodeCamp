            <p> was a group of shinobi that existed outside the usual system of hidden villages. Over the course of
                several decades, Akatsuki took different forms and
                was led by different individuals. Though each iteration is viewed as either subversives or criminals,
                all seek to make the world a better place through their own means. Each Akatsuki tends to have multiple
                lairs across the world, inaccessible either due to their remoteness or the various security measures
                that protect them </p>
